About this project:

The classification of social media ads is all about analyzing the ads for classifying whether your target audience will buy the product or not.

Classifying social media ads means analyzing your social media ads for finding the most profitable customers for your product who are more likely to buy the product. Sometimes the product you are offering is not suitable for all people when it comes to age and income. For example, a person between the ages of 20 and 25 may like to spend more on smartphone covers than a person between the ages of 40 and 45.
