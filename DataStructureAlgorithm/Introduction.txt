(1) What is algorithm ?
	The sequence of steps for problem solving.

(2) The characteristics of algorithm:
	- Input => The input can be zero or more.
	- Output => At least 1 output.
	- Defineteness => Everything must be clear.
	- Finiteness => Consists of finite stages.
	- Effectiveness => Must be effective as possible.

(3) Measure how good the algorithm:
    The most common measurement -> Time and Space.

(4) Using Big-O notation to estimate time and space complexity of algorithm:
    Definition of Big-O (according to math):
	"""
	f(N) = O(g(N)), if there exists positive constant c and positive integer N0 
	such that f(N) <= c * g(N) for all N >= N0.

	"""

    Explanation:
	- We could say that f(N) is actual function (commonly it is complex function) and O(g(N)) is the approximation function.
	- The "f(N) <= c * g(N)" means that it is asymptotic upper bound.
	- g(N) usually a simple function, such as "n", "n^2", "log(n)", etc.
	- For the choosen g(N), we can choose a constant c then determine 
	  the min boundary of the approximation works for N >= N0.

    E.g:
	f(n) = 2n + 3
	
	The possible answers:
	a. g(n) = 3n (that works on n >= 4)  
		-> O(n)
	b. g(n) = n^2 (that works on n>=4)
		-> O(n^2)
