1. Basic middleware.py file:
	> There are two main types:
	  - Downloader Middleware: Processes requests and responses between the Scrapy engine and the server.
	  - Spider Middleware: Processes items and requests between the spider and the Scrapy engine.

2. More detail explanation of methods middleware:
	> Explanation from_crawler(cls, crawler) method:
		- cls: class, commonly the code is written below decorator @classmethod so it reference to the current class.
		- crawler: Crawler object that uses current middleware. Crawler object provides access to all Scrapy core components like settings and signals; it is a way for middleware to access them and hook its functionality into Scrapy.
