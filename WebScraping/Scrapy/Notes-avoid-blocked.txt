1. What is headers?
   Headers is place to store metadata about the request or response.

2. Why we get blocked when web scraping?


  Some websites have its antibot, so to avoid getting blocked from website we just need to modify the headers. 
  In general there are three level to avoid getting blocked:
    (1) Modify its user-agent only in each request ==> For simple antibot, they just check the user-agent only and assume
          different user-agent means different person.

        NOTE: User-agent is sub-part of headers that give information about our agent (simplify information about our browser)
    (2) Modify ip address in each request ==> It requires using a proxy, VPN, or rotating IP service. Changing IP addresses frequently helps evade more advanced tracking techniques, but it requires external tools or services.

    (3) Modify all headers request information in each request ==>  Modifying all headers is the most complex because it involves configuring numerous details (like cookies, accept-language, cache-control, etc.), each of which can affect server response and detection methods. It requires careful adjustment to avoid inconsistencies and ensure the headers mimic a legitimate user accurately.
          

  NOTE: For complex antibot, we have to modify all headers in each request.


3. How to modify user-agent:
   i. In settings.py ==> by define variable "USER_AGENT"
     
      # In settings.py
      
      ## SOME CODE ##

      USER_AGENT = <user agent name>
      
      ## SOME CODE ##
   
   ii. In current spider file ==> Pass it as argument of headers in follow method response (or each time we want to make a request at specific page)

      # In current spider file
      import scrapy
        

      class <SpiderName>(scrapy.Spider):
          name = <spiderName>
          allowed_domains = [<allowed domains>]
          start_urls = [<starting point urls>]
		  
	  def parse(self, response):
       
	      ## SOME CODES ##

              yield response.follow(url=<path; absolute or relative path>, headers={'User-Agent': <user agent name>}
      
             ## SOME CODE ##

    iii. In middleware file (inside Downloader Middleware).

4. How to modify ip address using proxy
   - What is proxy?
	> A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet.
	> It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.

   - Simplest way to use proxy is by using middleware package called "scrapy-rotating-proxies" (Ref: https://pypi.org/project/scrapy-rotating-proxies/)
   - Another way we can subscribe proxy provider and integrate its API into our code.
