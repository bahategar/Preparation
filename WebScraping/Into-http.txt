1. What is HTTP?
   > HyperText Transfer Protocol is the set of rules for transferring files -- such as text, images, sound, video, and other multimedia files -- over the web.

   NOTE:
   	- HyperText refers to the nature of the documents that HTTP originally served --namely, hypertext documents.
        - As soon as a user opens their web broser, they are indirectly using HTTP.

2. Request-Response Model ==> HTTP operates on a request-response model.
   > We define client who makes request and server who processes the request and sends it back as response.
   > The models:
     [CLIENT] --> Make a request --> [SERVER] --> (PROCESS THE REQUEST) --> Send a response

   > HTTP is stateless which means Request-response pair is independent and does not rely on previous interactions.

   NOTE:
	- This design makes it simple and fast.
	- For maintain state across multiple request, we need mechanism like cookies or sessions.
	    NOTE: Even though HTTP is stateless, the sides of SERVER and CLIENT do not need to be stateless.

3. HTTPÂ is extensible, which means that the protocol allows for the addition of other information to the request and response.

4. HTTP Methods / Verbs (some common HTTP methods):
   - GET: Retrieve data from the server
   - POST: Send data to the server
   - PUT: Update or replace existing data on the server
   - DELETE: Remove data from the server

5. What is User Agent?
   > User agent: Data that identifies the client software (like a browser) making the request. 
User agent is string that helps the server identify the client making the request. The string contains details such as:
	- Browser type and version
	- Operating system
	- Device type
	- Rendering engine
	- Sometimes languages preferences or other settings.

6. What is Headers?
   > Headers are meta data (represented as key-value pairs) sent as part of HTTP requests and responses in web communication. 
   > Type of Headers:
	- Request Headers: Sent from the client to the server. They contain information about the client's request and details needed for the server to process it.
	- Response Headers: Sent from the server back to the client. They contain information about the response, like content type, content length, and any caching instructions.
